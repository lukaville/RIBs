/**
 * TODO reword to reflect new changes that configuration moved from ConfigurationCommand to here
 *
 * Represents a complex key to refer to a configuration, so that elements with different types
 * do not overwrite each other with the same index in the pool.
 *
 * Unique payloads are required to make a difference between elements that are changing in the
 * same Transaction, in the same position, but with different reflected Configuration.
 *
 * E.g. after a replace operation on the back stack, the following could happen:
 *
 * Transaction(Remove(Content(123)), Add(Content(123))
 *
 * Where even though they have the same position, they refer to different configurations. If executed
 * in the same Transaction, this could mean immediately removing the newly added Configuration.
 *
 * Payload in itself is allowed to repeat multiple times (same child RIB in back stack more
 * than once), but position + payload is a completely unique compound key per parent.
 *
 * Permanent keys don't need unique payload. Being permanent implies they won't ever get removed
 * or replaced.
 *

 * @see ConfigurationFeature.ActorImpl.resolve
