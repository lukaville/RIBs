     *  - keep in mind that in most cases you probably don't need to use interactor reference directly
     *      - its lifecycle methods are not accessible publicly (and it's good this way)
     *      - its internal consumers are usually reacting to children, and then it's better to
     *          trigger child workflows instead of faking them directly on the parent
     *  - as a general advice, try to trigger actions at points that are closest to where they would happen naturally,
     *      such that triggering involves executing all related actions (analytics, logging, etc)
